extension PKSImage {

    /// Loads and displays a modifiable image from the specified URL using
    /// a custom placeholder until the image loads.
    ///
    /// Until the image loads, SwiftUI displays the placeholder view that
    /// you specify. When the load operation completes successfully, SwiftUI
    /// updates the view to show content that you specify, which you
    /// create using the loaded image. For example, you can show a green
    /// placeholder, followed by a tiled version of the loaded image:
    ///
    ///     PKSImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png")) { image in
    ///         image.resizable(resizingMode: .tile)

    /// If the load operation fails, SwiftUI continues to display the
    /// placeholder. To be able to display a different view on a load error,
    /// use the ``init(url:scale:transaction:content:)`` initializer instead.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - url: The URL of the image to display.
    ///   - scale: The scale to use for the image. The default is `1`. Set a
    ///     different value when loading images designed for higher resolution
    ///     displays. For example, set a value of `2` for an image that you
    ///     would name with the `@2x` suffix if stored in a file on disk.
    ///   - content: A closure that takes the loaded image as an input, and
    ///     returns the view to show. You can return the image directly, or
    ///     modify it as needed before returning it.
    ///   - placeholder: A closure that returns the view to show until the

    /// ``AsyncImagePhase/success(_:)``. In the first case, the phase's
    /// ``AsyncImagePhase/error`` value indicates the reason for failure.
    /// In the second case, the phase's ``AsyncImagePhase/image`` property
    /// contains the loaded image. Use the phase to drive the output of the
